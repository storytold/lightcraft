# Control protocol

> Names in angle brackets (`<app>`, `<binary>`, `<cli>`, `<PREFIX>`, `<settings_dir>`, …) are the values set in
> [`brand.toml`](../brand.toml); see the README.

`<binary> --control 7980` (or `<PREFIX>_CONTROL_PORT=7980`) starts a JSON-lines server on
`127.0.0.1:7980` (loopback only). One request per line, one reply per line, in order:

```text
→ {"id": 1, "method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "photo.rate", "params": {"rating": 4}}}
← {"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": null}
← {"id": 2, "ok": false, "error": "unknown command `nope`"}
```

Requests are answered on the UI thread between frames (timeout 60 s).

**Only requests are read.** Every line must be a JSON object with a string `method` (`id` and `params` are
optional; blank lines are skipped). Anything else — text that isn't JSON, a JSON array or number, an object without
`method`, invalid UTF-8, or a line longer than 4 MiB — gets one error reply
(`{"ok": false, "error": "… closing the connection"}`) and the server **closes the connection**; nothing sent after
it on that connection runs. This keeps an HTTP request (for example a web page's cross-origin `fetch` to
`127.0.0.1:<port>`) from smuggling a command in its body: its request line is rejected first. Junk never reaches the
UI thread, and at most 16 connections are served at once (further ones get an error line and are closed). Clients
that hit an error reply should reconnect. The port has no authentication, so only enable it when you need it. The MCP server's connect
mode ([mcp.md](mcp.md)) is a thin layer over this channel. Implementation:
`crates/ui-egui/src/control.rs` (methods) and `apps/app/src/control_server.rs` (transport).

## Methods

| Method | Params | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `engine.execute` (alias `ui.menu.invoke`) | `{command, params?}` | Run any engine or UI command (see `engine.commands`) |
| `engine.commands` | — | Engine + UI commands: id, label, menu, shortcut, params doc, enabled |
| `ui.menu.list` | — | Menu entries (flat: id, label, menu path, shortcut, enabled) |
| `ui.menu.tree` | — | The menu bar as shown (File … Help): items `{id, params?, label, shortcut?, enabled, checked?}`, separators, submenus — the model behind the native macOS menu bar and the in-window menus |
| `ui.inspect` | — | UI state, window, `loupe` (`source`, and `region: {full, window, pending}` when a zoomed view also renders the window on screen at no more than 100 % — `full` is the frame it is cut from, `window` its `[x, y, w, h]` — and `regionBefore` for the Before side of a Before/After view), canvas/image rects, `scroll: {grid, filmstrip}` (scroll offsets in points, `null` until drawn), active photo, selection, perf (`frameMs` = layout, `logicMs` = per-frame logic before it, `updateMs` = both, `maxUpdateMs`, `fps`, render queue …, `gpu` = adapter in use, `gpuReason` = why renders don't use the GPU, `gpuFallback` = latest render redone on the CPU and why — see `docs/gpu-pipeline.md`), status, memory (bytes per cache, see `library.memory`; plus stage caches — `budgetBytes`, `trimmed`, `sharedSourceBytes` (the one device copy of a big original) — and textures), `export: {running: {total, done, current} \| null, last}`, `notices` (warnings waiting to be shown, e.g. a damaged settings file; OK = `button:noticeOk`), `quitPrompt` (why quitting was stopped: tasks that would be cut short are running — `button:quitAnyway` cancels them and quits, `button:quitCancel` keeps working — or unsaved changes: `button:quitRetry` / `button:quitAnyway` / `button:quitCancel`), `import: {done, total, imported, cancelled} \| null` (an import runs on a worker thread), `tasks` (other background work: `Find Missing Photos`, `Auto Import`), `activity` (every long-running task in flight as the activity stack in the top-left corner shows it, same shape as `activity.list`; a row appears once its task is 0.5 s old, ids `activity:row:<id>`, ✕ = `activity:cancel:<id>`, `activity:more` expands past 3 rows), `fileDialogs` (commands waiting on a native file dialog, which runs off the UI thread; they run again with the answer when it closes), `copied` (the text the UI last put on the clipboard, `null` until something is copied) |
| `ui.widgets` | `{filter?}` | On-screen widgets `{id, rect: [x, y, w, h]}` (screen points) |
| `ui.clickWidget` / `ui.dragWidget` / `ui.hoverWidget` | `{id, count?, button?, fx?, fy?}` (`button: "right"` right-clicks) / `{id, toX?, toY?, dx?, dy?, steps?}` / `{id, fx?, fy?}` | Real egui input on a widget (hover: the pointer rests on it, e.g. for preset/profile previews) |
| `ui.move` / `ui.click` / `ui.drag` | `{x, y, count?, button?}` / `{x, y, toX, toY, steps?}` | Raw pointer input, screen points |
| `ui.pointer` | `{events: [{kind: down\|drag\|up, x, y}], alt?, shift?, cmd?}` | Gesture in normalized image coordinates (Detail view) |
| `ui.key` | `{key, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}` | Key press |
| `ui.text` | `{text}` | Text input |
| `ui.clipboard` | `{action: cut\|copy\|paste, text?}` | Cut, copy or paste in the focused text field, as the system does for ⌘X / ⌘C / ⌘V; `paste` pastes `text`, or the system clipboard without it. Refused when no text field has the focus (outside one, ⌘C / ⌘V are the commands `develop.copy` / `develop.paste`). In the desktop app cut and copy write the system clipboard. `ui.inspect` → `copied` is the text the UI last put on the clipboard |
| `ui.scroll` | `{dx, dy, cmd?, ctrl?, shift?, alt?}` | Wheel / two-finger scroll at the current pointer; pans over the image, modifier-scroll zooms |
| `ui.zoom` | `{factor}` | Pinch zoom at the current pointer (positive scale multiplier; 1 = unchanged). Position it first with `ui.move` or `ui.hoverWidget` |
| `ui.set` | partial UI state, e.g. `{"view": "detail"}` | Resulting UI state |
| `ui.dialog.confirm` / `ui.dialog.cancel` | — | Close the open dialog |
| `ui.resize` | `{width, height}` | Resize the window |
| `ui.zoomFactor` | `{factor}` | Set the interface scale (0.5–3; egui's zoom keys are off, Cmd+= / Cmd+- zoom the photo) |
| `ui.screenshot` | `{path?, headless?}` | `{path, width, height}` once the frame (with finished renders) is captured. `headless: true` draws the UI on the CPU (no compositor needed); a windowed capture that gets no frame within 2 s falls back to headless automatically |
| `engine.execute {command: "app.export", params}` | export params (see `docs/mcp.md`), plus `preset`, `dir` / `path`, `ids`, `background` | Writes the files and returns `{files}`; with `background: true` (what the Export dialog and menus use) it returns `{background: true, total}` at once and the batch runs on a worker thread — poll `ui.inspect` → `export` |
| `engine.execute {command: "activity.list"}` | — | The long-running tasks in flight (imports, exports, preview builds, downloads, the face scan…), oldest first: `{tasks: [{id, kind, label, done, total, unit, detail, cancellable, cancelling, ageMs}]}`; `total` 0 = not known yet; `unit` is `count`, `bytes` or `percent`; `label` is English (the app shows it translated) |
| `engine.execute {command: "activity.cancel"}` | `{id}` or `{all: true}` | Asks the task (or every cancellable one) to stop at its next file or photo → `{cancelled: n}`; an unknown id (it may have just finished) or a task that can't be cancelled is an error |
| `ui.render` | `{id?, size?, path?}` | Render a photo (PNG to `path`), `{width, height}` |
| `app.quit` | — | Close the app |

Image navigation is also available directly as the UI command `view.navigate`, with
`{zoom?: "fit" | "fill" | {"percent": number}, pan?: [x, y]}`. Percentage zoom accepts fractional
values greater than 0 and at most 1100 (11:1); pan is the normalized image centre, with coordinates from 0 to 1.
`view.zoomLevel {level}` jumps to a named level: `fit`, `fill`, `1:4`, `1:3`, `1:2`, `1:1`, `2:1`, `3:1`, `4:1`,
`8:1` or `11:1` (Zoom In / Out step through the same levels).
Pinching keeps the image point under the pointer steady and zooms between Fit and 1100%; two-finger
scrolling pans in both axes and respects the operating system's scrolling direction and momentum.
These gestures work in Detail (including editing tools and full-screen preview), Compare and Reference
views, and only apply over their image areas. Panning stops at the image edges.

Mask brushing uses the UI command `tool.brush` through `engine.execute`. With `{}` it activates
painting on the current mask. `{"new": true}` creates a separate brush mask; `{"op": "add"}` or
`{"op": "subtract"}` appends a brush component to the selected mask. Creating either starts in
paint mode with the overlay visible. Brush Erase (or Alt while painting) removes strokes' coverage
within that brush component; it is distinct from subtracting the component from the whole mask.

### When the library can't be saved

With a persistent library, every command that changes something is written to the catalog journal (fsynced) before
it replies. If that write fails (disk full, volume gone, permissions), the command replies `ok: false` with
`"saved in memory but not written to disk: <reason>; the app will retry"`. The change itself **is** applied (and
undoable) and stays queued: the next command, and the app's frame loop every couple of seconds, retry the write, so
nothing is lost once the disk is writable again — unless the app quits first. Meanwhile `ui.inspect` → `unsaved`
is `{ops, error}` (else `null`), `library.info` reports `unsavedOps` / `unsavedError`, and the top bar's cloud icon
shows a warning (widget `indicator:unsaved`). Queries and commands that change nothing still succeed. A failed
compaction (snapshot) is not a failed command — the log is kept whole — and only shows in `library.info` →
`lastError`.

### When the library can't be opened

If the desktop app can't open its library at launch (another program has it open, an unreadable or newer-format
catalog, a missing drive), the session starts empty and in memory — never with demo photos — and a window asks what
to do: `ui.inspect` → `libraryProblem` is `{path, error, temporarySession, pendingImport}` (else `null`); its buttons
are `button:libraryRetry`, `button:libraryChoose`, `button:libraryTemporary` (Continue Without Saving) and
`button:libraryQuit`. A temporary session shows a banner (`indicator:temporarySession`, `button:libraryReopen`) and
writes nothing. `app.openLibrary` opening a library ends it.

## Headless rendering (no window, no GPU)

The egui UI can be rasterized on the CPU (`crates/ui-egui/src/softpaint.rs`, driven by
`crates/ui-egui/src/headless.rs`): same tessellation, gamma-space premultiplied blending and
scissor clipping as egui's GPU backends, so the image matches the window (minus GPU dithering).

- **In the running app:** `{"method": "ui.screenshot", "params": {"path": "a.png", "headless": true}}`.
  The UI is drawn into an offscreen context from the app's logic tick, which keeps running when the
  window is occluded or the display sleeps/locks. Windowed screenshots fall back to this after 2 s.
- **Without any app window:** `<cli> snapshot` runs a whole app session headlessly.
  Photo development also defaults to the CPU, so the initial frames do not discover a GPU adapter
  or load a graphics driver. `<PREFIX>_GPU=1` does not opt snapshots back into GPU rendering.
  This applies only to the snapshot session: even `--library DIR` leaves the desktop app's saved
  `ui.json` preferences untouched. It answers the same control requests (same handler) from a JSON-lines script:

```text
<cli> snapshot --demo -o grid.png --size 1600x1000 [--scale 2]
<cli> snapshot --library DIR --script tour.jsonl -o shot.png
```

Headless screenshot dimensions must be finite and at least one logical point, with a finite,
positive scale. Rounded output must be at least one pixel per edge, at most 16,384 pixels
per edge and 64 million pixels in total. `snapshot` and `ui.resize` reject requests outside
these limits before layout or rasterization; supplied resize dimensions must be numbers.
An interface zoom (egui's zoom factor; the keyboard never changes it — ⌘= / ⌘− / ⌘0 zoom the
photo, issue #566) changes text and control sizes while preserving the snapshot viewport's requested
physical pixel dimensions. Later `ui.resize` requests use current egui points; validation
and rasterization both convert them to native viewport points before rounding the output
pixels. A native edge below one point after zooming out is valid if it rounds to at least
one pixel.

  `tour.jsonl` holds one request per line (`#` comments allowed), e.g.
  `{"method": "ui.set", "params": {"view": "detail", "right": "edit", "openSections": ["optics"]}}`
  then `{"method": "ui.screenshot"}`. Replies are printed to stdout. A failed request
  (`"ok": false`) does not stop the script — the remaining lines and the final screenshot still
  run — but the exit status is non-zero when any request failed, as with `run --keep-going`, so
  CI and nightly runs can judge a snapshot by its exit status. A `ui.screenshot` without
  `path` writes `-o` (then `OUT-2.png`, `OUT-3.png`, …); `ui.settle {timeoutMs?}` waits until no
  renders are in flight. Each request runs frames until it is answered and its injected input
  (clicks, keys, drags) has played out. Widget ids for `ui.clickWidget` come from `ui.widgets`
  (e.g. `button:upright-auto`). A 1600×1000 demo snapshot takes ~1–2 s (debug build).
