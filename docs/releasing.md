# Releasing LightCraft

The release pipeline is [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).
It runs on every push to the `release` branch. A maintainer can also dispatch it manually, with
an optional version override such as `1.2.0-rc.1`; the release environment's branch restrictions
still apply.

## Prepare and start a release

1. Merge the release-ready changes into `release`.
2. Set the workspace version in `Cargo.toml` (for example, with `cargo xtask version set 1.2.0`).
   For a manual workflow run, the version input can override the workspace version for that run.
   Use a semantic version such as `1.2.0` or `1.2.0-rc.1`; versions containing a hyphen are
   marked as prereleases.
3. Push to `release`, or dispatch the workflow on `release` (a dispatch on another branch is a dry run; see below).
4. Check the workflow run and its artifacts. On success, the workflow creates or updates a **draft**
   GitHub Release named `LightCraft v<version>`, targeted at the commit that triggered the run.
   Review the draft and its `SHA256SUMS.txt`, then publish it in GitHub Releases when ready.

The workflow replaces assets when it updates an existing draft. It stops rather than overwriting a
release that has already been published, so bump the version before producing another release.

## Builds and artifacts

Release jobs build macOS universal, Windows x86/x64/ARM64, Linux x86_64/aarch64, FreeBSD x86_64,
and the WASM web app. The platform scripts in [`packaging/`](../packaging/) write their outputs to
`dist/release/` (the full list of files is the README's Downloads section):

- macOS: app DMG and CLI ZIP.
- Windows: MSI installer and portable ZIP for each architecture.
- Linux: AppImage (with its `.AppImage.zsync`), `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.tar.gz` for each
  architecture (`packaging/linux/package.sh`). Each AppImage embeds
  `gh-releases-zsync|storytold|lightcraft|latest|lightcraft-*-linux-<arch>.AppImage.zsync`, so
  AppImageUpdate fetches only the changed blocks from the latest published (non-pre-) release.
- Flatpak: a single-file `.flatpak` bundle for each architecture, repackaged from that
  architecture's Linux tarball (`packaging/linux/flatpak-bundle.sh` with
  `packaging/linux/flatpak/ai.storyteller.lightcraft.bundle.yml`; no Rust build). The from-source
  manifest `ai.storyteller.lightcraft.yml` is for Flathub; packaging-lint keeps their runtime and
  `finish-args` identical.
- FreeBSD: `lightcraft-<version>-freebsd-x86_64.tar.gz`, a `/usr/local`-style tree built in a
  FreeBSD 14.3 VM (`packaging/freebsd/package.sh`, the same packages as `freebsd.yml`). Install
  with `tar -xzf <file> --strip-components 1 -C /usr/local`.
- Web: `lightcraft-web-<version>.zip`.

Only the macOS, Windows and draft-release jobs use the `release` environment. The others sign
nothing, so dispatching the workflow on a branch (`gh workflow run release.yml --ref <branch>`)
dry-runs them: the signing jobs are refused by the environment's branch rule, and the release job,
which needs them, is skipped.

The Linux builds run on Ubuntu 22.04 and target glibc 2.35 or newer. AppImages and binaries may
also require system libraries for the windowing stack; the `.deb` and `.rpm` packages declare
their runtime dependencies.

Release builds fetch the pinned [`storytold/craft-fonts`](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts)
revision and require it (`CRAFT_FONTS_REQUIRED=1`). Keep that pin deliberate when updating the
workflow, and bump it (in `release.yml`, five jobs, and `freebsd.yml`) whenever craft-fonts adds a face a
shipped language needs: a stale pin still builds, it just ships tofu (issue #319: v0.4.0 pinned a revision
from before Noto Sans CJK SC, so Simplified Chinese had no glyphs). Before a release, check the pin against
craft-fonts' `fonts/manifest.txt` and run `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR=../craft-fonts cargo test -p lightcraft-ui-egui i18n`,
whose glyph-coverage test checks the characters in available faces. `CRAFT_FONTS_REQUIRED=1` now also makes
the native build fail if the pinned manifest lacks Noto Sans CJK SC Regular (`Hans`) or BIZ UDPGothic Regular;
the web build requires BIZ UDPGothic Regular and packages Noto Sans CJK SC as a separate asset.

## Signing credentials

All credentials are stored as secrets in the GitHub `release` environment. Signing is optional:
without platform signing credentials, packaging continues with unsigned artifacts and warnings.
macOS notarization is a separate optional step; when its credentials are absent, a build with a
signing identity is signed but not notarized. Configure only the platform credentials you need:

- **macOS signing:** `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, and `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`.
  **Notarization** additionally needs all of `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` (an app-specific
  password), and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.
- **Windows signing:** either `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` and `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, or Azure
  Trusted Signing credentials: `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`,
  `AZURE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`, and `AZURE_CERT_PROFILE`.

Linux and web artifacts are not code-signed by this workflow. The release job computes SHA-256
checksums for the complete artifact set and attaches the checksum file to the draft release.
