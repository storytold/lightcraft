# RAW parity: cameras, formats, demosaic, colour and lens profiles

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-13 · **Change:** minor (Canon CRW decoded clean-room: EOS D30/D60/10D/300D, PowerShot G1/G6 verified exact, G5 preview; Leica Q3 and EOS R5 Mark II verified) · **Target:** Adobe Lightroom Classic 15.5 / Lightroom 9.6 (Camera Raw 18.7)

Raw processing is the deepest single dimension of Lightroom parity: a photographer whose camera
does not decode, or decodes with the wrong colour, cannot switch. This document measures it model by
model. The numbers feed [target-app-parity.md](target-app-parity.md); individual shortfalls are
ranked in [gaps.md](gaps.md). Details per format: [cr3.md](cr3.md),
[raf-compression.md](raf-compression.md), [sony-lens-corrections.md](sony-lens-corrections.md),
[camera-preview-colour.md](camera-preview-colour.md), [denoise.md](denoise.md).

## Headline

| Adobe-listed camera models | **1,446** | measured: [raw/adobe-cameras.tsv](raw/adobe-cameras.tsv) |
| Decoded from sensor data and **verified** on a real file | **243** (17%) | measured: [raw/evidence.tsv](raw/evidence.tsv) |

| **Preview-only** (embedded JPEG) | **217** (15%) | measured |
| **Unsupported** (not imported, refused or decodes wrongly) | **36** (2%) | measured |
| Models added since 2017 (Camera Raw 10+): verified / unverified / preview / unsupported | 83 / 639 / 24 / 8 of 754 | measured |

| **RAW readiness** (decoding 60%, colour 25%, lens 15%) | **~56%** (range 50–60%) | estimated, see [Scores](#scores) |

Re-measure with `python3 docs/raw/coverage.py` (standard library only): it classifies every Adobe
model from the format rules in the script (which mirror `crates/raw/src`) plus the per-model evidence,
rewrites [raw/coverage.tsv](raw/coverage.tsv) and prints the tables below; `--check` fails when the
committed table is stale.

## How it was measured

- **Adobe's list**: helpx "Camera Raw supported cameras" (the live page refuses scripted requests, so
  the Wayback Machine capture of 2026-10-03 was parsed): 1,446 camera rows from 40 makers after
  dropping profile-only rows; maker, model, extension(s), Camera Matching profile, minimum Camera Raw
  version. The year a model was added is approximated from that Camera Raw major version.
- **What we decode**: the decoders and their refusals in `crates/raw/src` (`lib.rs` routing, `vendor/*.rs`
  coding variants, `crx.rs` CRX limits, `orf.rs` / `srw.rs` compressed refusals), the import list
  `lightcraft_engine::import::EXTENSIONS`, and `KNOWN_UNSUPPORTED` in `crates/raw/tests/corpus.rs`. Doc
  claims were not used.
- **Verified** means a real file from that body decoded from sensor data in: the corpus test over the
  `RAW_SAMPLES` manifest (`xtask/src/main.rs`, 101 CC0 files; bodies whose sample is in
  `KNOWN_UNSUPPORTED` excluded), `crates/raw/tests/cr3_corpus.rs` (3 bodies exact against an external decoder;
  the EOS R5 Mark II pinned, with a QP-map check of 33,665 private files), the RAF reference
  check ([raf-compression.md](raf-compression.md)), and the raw.pixls.us bulk checks recorded in issue
  #535 (all 100 Sony bodies there; 87 decode) and PR #215 (every Panasonic / Leica RW2 / RWL / RAW body
  there, 178 files from 118 bodies), and a recorded check of 38 private Leica Q3 DNGs (2026-10-11: every file
  decoded and developed at full size, 9520 × 6336 and 6336 × 9520; mean CIE76 ΔE to the camera JPEG 6.3–13.9
  at 400 px; the files are not committed). Bulk-check body lists were matched to Adobe names through the
  raw.pixls.us folder names. Checks without a body list (≈ 60 NEFs, 35 CR2 bodies for the CFA layout)
  are not counted as verified.
- **Usage weights** ([raw/usage-weights.tsv](raw/usage-weights.tsv)): maker buckets from 2025 market
  data (Nikkei production: Canon ~36%, Sony ~29%, Nikon ~14%, Fujifilm ~12% of mirrorless; BCN retail:
  Sony 29.9%, Canon 27.4%, Nikon 15.1%), adjusted for the DSLR installed base and for the makers named
  in this repo's 325 user issues (Sony 33, Nikon 31, Canon 26, phones 23, Fujifilm 9, Panasonic / Leica
  8, OM / Olympus 6, Pentax / Ricoh 6). Inside each bucket, 80% goes to the popular bodies of the last
  ~8 years (listed in the file), 20% to the bucket's other Adobe models.
- **Per-format confidence** for unverified bodies (the chance their files decode correctly): DNG, CR2,
  RAF, RW2 0.95; NEF, ARW, PEF 0.9; ORF, SRW, SR2 0.8; **CR3 0.6** (the CRX decoder refuses several
  coding variants and only four bodies are verified; maintainers report the R7 working).

## By maker (measured)

| **All** | **1,446** | **243 (17%)** | **950 (66%)** | **217 (15%)** | **36 (2%)** | |

## By use (estimated)

| Bucket | Weight | Camera fully works | On a verified body | Why |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Canon | 33% | 76% | 21% | 18 of the 22 popular bodies write CR3; 4 of them verified (M50, R8, R100, R5 Mark II), the rest at 0.6; CRW decoded |
| Sony | 27% | 98% | 91% | bulk-checked |
| Nikon | 16% | 91% | 12% | decoders cover every NEF coding but HE; few bodies verified |
| Fujifilm | 10% | 91% | 45% | |
| Panasonic | 4% | 100% | 98% | bulk-checked |
| OM / Olympus | 3% | 3% | 1% | compressed ORF |
| Phones | 3% | 93% | 1% | DNG |
| Pentax / Ricoh | 1.5% | 94% | 14% | |
| Leica | 1% | 96% | 21% | the Q3 verified |
| DJI | 1% | 95% | 0% | |
| Medium format and others | 0.5% | 23% | 1% | IIQ, 3FR, X3F |
| **Weighted** | 100% | **85%** | **42%** | |

About 5 in 6 raw photographers' cameras decode, but only about 2 in 5 use a body we have actually
checked, and Canon, the largest bucket, is the weakest of the big four.

### Compressed ORF: a clean-room starting point

Two Olympus patents by Takashi Ishikawa describe the *method* of lossless RAW compression in prose; neither names ORF
and neither gives the file layout. See the closed #240 and the open #360 for why a decoder has to be derived from the
files and prose rather than from dcraw-family code.

- [US7333035B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7333035): lossless RAW compression for SLR cameras:
  median-edge-detector prediction from the left, upper and upper-left neighbours, a separately coded sign, Golomb-Rice
  codes whose parameter `k` comes from flatness run counters, counters reset per line.
- [US7715639B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7715639B2/en): a sibling with predictor variants, `k` derived from
  neighbouring positions, raw low-order bits and a correction filter.

They give the algorithm's shape; constants, the bit layout and the stream header still have to be established from CC0
sample files. A pointer for contributors, not legal advice.

## Colour

| Item | Adobe | LightCraft |
|---|---|---|
| Default profile per model | Adobe Standard for every model (1,500 profile names in the bundle) | the DNG's own matrices; else a pooled profile (**4 bundled**: ILCE-7CR, ILCE-7M4, X-H2S, X-T4); else a guarded per-file fit to the camera's embedded JPEG; else spectral matrices (**52 models**, rawtoaces-data); else a neutral matrix |
| Camera Matching looks | 481 models (plus phone-maker looks) | none (the per-file JPEG fit imitates the camera's own look) |
| Creative profiles | Adobe Color, Portrait, Landscape, Vivid, Monochrome… | our own looks (Color, Neutral, Vivid, Landscape, Portrait, Monochrome) |
| DCP / dual-illuminant model | ✅ | dual-illuminant DNG colour (ColorMatrix / ForwardMatrix 1-2, CameraCalibration, AnalogBalance), HueSatMap, LookTable, ProfileToneCurve; external `.dcp` never loaded (clean-room) |
| White balance in Kelvin | ✅ for every model | absolute Kelvin where the camera has colour matrices (its own, or one of the 52 spectral rows), also for files whose look is a per-file fit (#730), or where Sony's white-balance presets in the file give the scale (6 bodies, `kelvin_presets`); other raws keep the relative scale (#296) |

**How far the default rendering is from Adobe's** (CIE ΔE; measured where stated):

- Against the camera JPEG (what the fit targets): the Sony bulk check (#535) accepted fits on 81 of 87
  bodies, median ΔE 5.1, ΔL\* +0.2; rejected fits fall back to a neutral matrix at median ΔE 18.5,
  ΔL\* −11, chroma ×0.39. RW2 140 of 174 files accepted, median 5.0. NEF 13 of 13, 2.9–7.8. RAF 23 of
  24, pooled X-H2S 1.62 / X-T4 2.34. SRW 2.2–7.6.
- Against Lightroom itself (few): Sony DRO median ΔE76 7.5 → 3.3; Olympus E-1 vs Lightroom Classic
  ΔE00 11.25 → 8.30; ProRAW with its gain map ΔE00 19 (why the map is off). No measurement against
  Adobe Standard across models exists.
- User evidence: 33 open issues about raw colour or rendering (wrong colours, dark, flat, green,
  desaturated), the largest group of open core-path issues.

**Colour score ~35%** (estimated): most decoded files start close to the camera's own look (ΔE ~5),
about 10% start far off (ΔE ~18), nothing is calibrated, Kelvin WB is missing for fitted cameras without colour matrices, and
the distance to Adobe Standard is unmeasured. In the readiness numbers this becomes a colour factor
of ×0.85 for a working photographer (they correct colour by hand, at a cost) and ×0.75 for the
essentials user (the default look is what they keep).

## Lens profiles

| Item | Adobe | LightCraft |
|---|---|---|
| Profile database | 3,635 profile files, 56 makers, auto-selected | **0** (Adobe LCPs never used; no database of our own) |
| In-file corrections | ✅ | DNG opcodes (WarpRectilinear, FixVignetteRadial, GainMap…) applied; Panasonic / Leica RW2 distortion (79 photos, 13 bodies, 11 lenses); Sony tag 0x7037 distortion for the ILCE-7RM4A (2 lenses) |
| Vignetting / lateral CA from maker notes | ✅ | ⬜ |
| Manual distortion, vignetting, CA, defringe | ✅ | ✅ |

**Lens score ~10%** (estimated): automatic correction reaches roughly Panasonic / Leica, phone and
drone DNG users (~9% of photographers by the weights above); Adobe reaches nearly everyone.

## Scores

| Part | Weight | Score | Basis |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Decoding | 60% | **77%** | use-weighted 85% × 0.9 (76.5%) for per-body decode bugs still surfacing (levels, crops, WB: #535, #455, #461, #702) |
| Colour | 25% | **35%** | see [Colour](#colour) |
| Lens profiles | 15% | **10%** | see [Lens profiles](#lens-profiles) |
| **RAW readiness** | 100% | **~56%** (range 50–60%) | 45.9 + 8.75 + 1.5; demosaic and highlight quality unmeasured |

The previous estimate (earlier on 2026-10-10) was ~50%, with decoding at ~78% weighted by maker
from the format list alone. Measured model by model, decoding comes out about the same; the change is
the written decomposition, not new decoding.

## Remaining work, ranked by photographers unlocked per hour

Hours are Opus 5.5 agent hours, calibrated on this repo's raw PRs: RW2 every format 6.5 h (#215),
compressed RAF 8.6 h (#282), CR3 CRX 10 h (#279), NEF lossy after split 4.7 h (#633), ORF 12.8 bpp
1.7 h (#651), HEIC 7 h (#609). "Gain" is the change in the use-weighted share whose camera fully
works, from [raw/usage-weights.tsv](raw/usage-weights.tsv).

| # | Camera / variant | Gain (points of photographers) | Hours | Gain per hour | Needs |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---|

| 2 | CR3: remaining CRX variants, then verify the other 14 popular CR3 bodies | +6.2 | 25–45 | ~0.19 | samples per body (raw.pixls.us has most) |
| 3 | Verify popular Nikon, Fujifilm, Canon CR2 and Pentax bodies (one CC0 file each, fix what breaks) | +2.0 | 8–15 | ~0.17 | public samples |
| 4 | Nikon packed 14-bit under a compressed tag (Z 6II uncompressed, #769) | +0.2 | 1–2 | ~0.13 | PR #671 exists |
| 5 | Sony DSLR-A200…A390 / A850 12-bit compressed ARW | +0.4 | 3–6 | ~0.08 | samples on raw.pixls.us |
| 6 | Pre-X FinePix RAF | +0.6 | 4–8 | ~0.08 | samples |
| 7 | Sony A100 and DSC-F828 regression (#702) | +0.1 | 1–2 | ~0.07 | samples on raw.pixls.us |
| 8 | Nikon HE / HE★ NEF (Z 8, Z 9, Z 6III, Z f, Z50II, Z5II set to HE) | +1.1 | 20–40 | ~0.04 | a pure-Rust JPEG XS decoder |
| 9 | Compressed SRW, Hasselblad 3FR, IIQ, X3F, MRW, KDC, ERF, DCR, MEF, GPR | +0.6 together | 45–85 | ~0.01 | samples; low use |

Beyond decoding:

| Gap | Hours | Needs |
|---|---:|---|
| Measured colour calibration for the ~60 popular bodies, Kelvin WB for cameras without matrices, render-fidelity suite against Lightroom | 80–150 | chart shots per camera (a human with cameras) or licensable measured data |
| Lens profile database of our own (fitting tools, data format, top 100 lenses), maker-note vignetting / CA | 40–80 | calibration shots (a human with lenses) |
| Demosaic and highlight quality measured against Lightroom; X-Trans AI denoise | 15–30 | |
| **Total RAW** | **255–480 h** (decoding list above 120–220 h; ~60% parallelizes) | |
