//! Auto straighten: the crop angle that levels a photo, from three cues on the analysis image
//! ([`crate::upright::analysis_plane`]), tried in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Plumb lines**: the roll from the vertical vanishing point. Verticals that converge in
//!    perspective (a building shot upward) still name the camera's roll, where their mean tilt
//!    doesn't. Only a vanishing point backed by many lines across the frame counts.
//! 2. **The horizon**: the straight line across the whole width along which it is brighter on one
//!    side than on the other (sky and sea, sky and land). It is scored by its weaker columns, so
//!    the edges of waves, clouds or a ridge, which hold only in places, don't make one.
//! 3. **Long lines**: the consensus of near-horizontal or near-vertical segments (the rule Upright
//!    Level uses), with at least [`MIN_LINES`] agreeing. It also vetoes a horizon it disagrees with.
//!
//! Nothing past [`MAX_DEGREES`] is levelled.
//!
//! Measured on 113 photos straightened by hand in Lightroom Classic: 50 come out straighter and
//! 10 more tilted (the long lines alone: 27 and 9), and the mean error is 0.83° instead of 1.24°
//! untouched (1.07° with the long lines alone). Of 300 photos left as shot, 21 are turned by more
//! than 1° (the long lines alone: 20), and of 300 taken at ISO 3200 or more, 49 (47).
