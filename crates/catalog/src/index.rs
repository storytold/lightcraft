//! Lookups derived from the catalog's own data, so questions asked once per photo of a big library
//! don't scan a list each time: which stack a photo is in, whether a regular album holds it.
//!
//! They are never saved (the on-disk format is unchanged). Each is built on first use from what
//! the catalog holds, so a catalog read from a snapshot, replayed from the journal or cloned starts
//! without them and builds them when asked. Once built, [`crate::Catalog::apply`] keeps them up to
//! date: the ops that change stacks or album photos (`AddStack`, `RemoveStack`, `SetStack`,
//! `AddAlbum`, `RemoveAlbum`, `SetAlbumPhotos`) update them as they apply, inverses and the
//! rollback of a failed batch included, as those are ops too.
